how to debug
============

Resetting the processor

monitor reset halt - Once we flash new code, or if we just want the
"program" to start over, we call monitor reset halt to reset and halt
the processor. This will freeze the processor at the reset state,
before any code has executed.

You must call monitor reset halt after (or immediately before) a load
command so that the processor starts from the new code. Otherwise, the
processor will likely crash, sometimes after appearing to work for
some time. To avoid nightmare debug sessions, be sure you always
follow load with monitor reset halt!

(this works with openocd)


once the code is loaded *** use 'continue' *** not run. The reset has
reinitialized the PC and SP.

openocd command
---------------
ssh black.local
openocd -f /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/board/st_nucleo_f4.cfg



watch out
=========

apparently it is possible to link a mixture of arm and thumb
instructions if one is not careful. linking must be done with gcc (as
opposed to ld) and the appropriate arch and common args passed in
order to ensure gcc links the correct run time.

TODO: figure out what --spec=nano.specs does.
