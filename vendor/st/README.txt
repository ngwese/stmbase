This directory is contains a subset of the STM32CubeF4 embedded
software package provided by ST.

http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM147/CL1794/SC961/SS1743/LN1897/PF259243

The original version was STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.11.0.

The structure has been modified in the following ways:

- All documentation, projects, examples, and precompiled binaries have
  been removed to cut down on size.

- All files related to compilers other than gcc have been removed.

- The directory structure has been lightly re-organized and made
  consistent to allow for a more modular structure in the build
  system.
